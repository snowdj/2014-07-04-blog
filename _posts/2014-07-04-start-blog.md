Hello, World!

I just borrow the blog system from https://github.com/thedereck/gh-pages-blog/

It looks good. Hope I can use it for my blog.

* The only thing I don't know is what is the setting of disqus.

I think I need to change body/sections/javascript/post/disqus.html.

But actually just change config.yml

disqus :
  enabled : true
  shortname : snowdj
  show_comment_count : true

* Change footer.html.
