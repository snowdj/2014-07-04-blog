Hello, World!

After try different template for the blog.

I decide to use this gh-pages-blog from https://github.com/thedereck/gh-pages-blog/.

I have not figure out all the setting, but it is good enough for my little blog.

First, I would like to start a plan.

Every day, I try to write some thing to practise my writing and criticl thinking.

Only when I am writing, I tidy up my thinking and carry on my plan.

Otherwise, I just am wondering in different topics.

Ok, let me get start. Let me get into the business.

## baseurl

baseurl is necessary for the jekyll-bootstrap's index.html.   

## layout and include and css

defualt page post html should be in layout and include. all css in the asset/ theme respectly.
